# Memory allocation visualization

This simulator graphically describes different memory allocation methods.
Processes are separated by a semicolon (;). Each process has allocated memory amount and duration time, separated by a comma.
This was created for a school project and is made using HTML, JavaScript and a little bit of CSS.
